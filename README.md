# Auto Disc Image Creator
Script allows you to create disc images in a quick way in Windows 10 (at least). The only action you need to take is to insert new disks into the disk drive when the previous disk is ejected.

The script is written for the CDBurnerXP tool.

## Running the script:
Download CDBurnerXP tool from here: https://cdburnerxp.se/en/download and install it.

After the installation edit your `Path` Environment Variable to access the installed tool from anywhere via CMD.

Run the script from the directory where you want to create disk images.

Insert disc into disc drive.

After image creation disc will be automatically ejected.

Insert another one.
